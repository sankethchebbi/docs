According to ChatGPT _A "second brain" is a digital platform designed to serve as an extension of your mind, allowing you to store, organize, and access vast amounts of information on specific topics.

I know right? It's a fascinating idea!ðŸ’¡
There are a lot of writings on the internet that I enjoy reading - from [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) to [Eric. S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/) for their essays and [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) for the mental models. I also enjoy watching _Horses_ on Youtube by [Michael Sorenson](https://www.youtube.com/@HorsesOnYT).  

I feel I might not have a lot of useful information to put out there so, I don't write much. Whatever I find interesting about a subject, I jot it down in here for future reference.
